                                    <p>The Luminary Addendum contains terms regarding the creation and posting
                                        of Experience Listings, how and what Luminaries get paid for their
                                        Experiences and other terms specific to a Luminary’s provision of
                                        Experiences in connection with the Services. Unless otherwise defined in

                                        in the IfOnly Terms. &nbsp;</p>
                                    <p>Please read this Luminary Addendum carefully. &nbsp;If you don’t agree to
                                        its terms and conditions you aren’t permitted to become a Luminary and
                                        you may not offer Experiences in connection with the Services. Traina

                                    <p>For each Experience, you will create an Experience Listing via the
                                        Luminary portal page. When you do so, you will be asked a series of
                                        questions about the Experience that will structure your experience in an
                                        appropriate way; you may also choose certain requirements which must be
                                        met by End Users, including but not limited to the recommended health,
                                        fitness and skill level and time and location for the Experience. You
                                        will also set the price for your Experience, as further described below
                                        under the section titled “<strong>Financial Terms</strong>”.</p>
                                    <p>After you complete your Experience Listing and submit it to the Services,
                                        we will review it as further described on the Site. You can visit our <a
                                            href="/faq">Luminary FAQs
                                            Page</a> for additional information on the approval process for
                                        listings. &nbsp;Once your Experience Listing is approved, the applicable
                                        Experience will be offered for sale for a price set by you or, if
                                        applicable, for the price set by an auction via the Services.</p>
                                    <p>Your ability to change or modify an Experience Listing after it’s been
                                        posted to the Services depends on the type of Experience: (i) for
                                        Experiences that are physical or digital Products, the Experience
                                        Listing can be modified up until the time the Experience is purchased,
                                        and (ii) for Experiences that require the End User and Luminary to agree
                                        on particulars like the time and location for the Experience (“<strong>Scheduled
                                            Experiences</strong>”), the Experience Listing can be modified up
                                        until the time a &nbsp;Registered User has submitted a request to
                                        schedule your Experience.</p>
                                    <p>Traina Interactive has the right to terminate the offering of any
                                        Experience via the Services and remove any Experience Listing at any
                                        time for any reason in Traina Interactive’s sole discretion (including,
                                        without limitation, if such Experience is related to any unlawful
                                        activity or is inconsistent with Traina Interactive’s brand identity).
                                        Traina Interactive does not act as an insurer or as your contracting
                                        agent. We recommend that you obtain appropriate insurance for any

                                    <p>The modification of an Experience Listing is not the same as offering a
                                        post-purchase request negotiated between yourself and the purchaser
                                        (“<strong>Change Request</strong>”) option with your Experience. If you
                                        choose to allow Change Requests in connection with your Experience, you
                                        can indicate the availability of this option in your Experience Listing.
                                        You may set the minimum number of days from the experience where you
                                        will accept Change Requests; after this date, the buyer will no longer
                                        be able to request changes. The Service will display the additional cost
                                        for requests altering an existing option for your experience, such as
                                        location or number of people, to the customer when offered and will
                                        automatically charge any additional costs (“<strong>Change Fees</strong>”)
                                        when accepted. You will also be able to set an additional custom Change
                                        Fee for any Change Requests received from the customer that are outside
                                        the parameters of your existing Experience. This custom Change Fee will
                                        be displayed to the customer, who will have the option to accept or deny
                                        the new fee. The Change Fee will not be charged to the customer until
                                        both sides accept the change.</p>
                                    <p>If you have an approval right with respect to potential Experience
                                        participants, you must provide your acceptance or rejection of such
                                        participants within the time period designated by Traina
                                        Interactive.</p>
                                    <p>For Scheduled Experiences, you must respond to a request to schedule your
                                        Experience within seventy-two (72) hours, but recommend a prompt
                                        response whenever possible. &nbsp;Otherwise, the request may be
                                        automatically rejected. IfOnly may, at their discretion, make a good
                                        faith effort to contact you if you do not reply to a schedule requests
                                        in a timely manner. Traina Interactive reserves the right to remove your
                                        Experiences and/or Luminary account from the Services if you do not
                                        respond to schedule requests. The time of receipt of the scheduling
                                        request will be tracked via the Services. &nbsp;If you and the End User
                                        agree on the time and location (as applicable) for the Experience,
                                        Traina Interactive will send you and the End User a scheduling
                                        confirmation email.</p>

                                        experience with a ticket minimum set by you. If you choose to create a
                                        Crowd Buy event that requires a minimum number of sold tickets to occur,
                                        you will have to provide specific information in your Experience Listing
                                        including the scheduled date and time for the Crowd Buy Event, the
                                        Ticket Minimum, and the Ticket Cut Off Date. You will be required to set
                                        a Ticket Cut Off Date that is at least 7 days prior to the date the
                                        applicable Experience is scheduled to take place.&nbsp; After the Ticket

                                        tickets have been sold out. If the Ticket Minimum is not reached by the
                                        Ticket Cut Off Date, you will have one day to manually confirm the
