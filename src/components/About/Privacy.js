                                    <p>Your privacy is important to us. Accordingly, we’re providing this Privacy Policy
                                        to explain our practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of
                                        information that we receive when you use our Services. This Privacy Policy does
                                        not apply to any third-party websites, services or applications.&nbsp; Any
                                        information that we collect is subject to the privacy policy in effect at the
                                        time that information is collected.&nbsp; We may, however, modify and revise
                                        this Privacy Policy from time to time.&nbsp; If we make any material changes to
                                        this Privacy Policy, we’ll notify you of those changes by posting them on the

                                        Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms of Service.</p>

                                    <p><strong>How do we collect and use information?</strong></p>
                                    <p>Our primary goals in collecting information are to provide and improve our
                                        Services, to administer your use of the Services (including your Account, if you
                                        are a Member), to provide you with more relevant Experiences recommendations and
                                        otherwise improve the Services, and to enable you to easily offer, browse and
                                        purchase Experiences.&nbsp;</p>

                                    <p>Account Information. If you create an Account, we’ll collect certain information
                                        that can be used to identify you, such as your name, email address, postal
                                        address and phone number (“<strong>PII</strong>”). If you create an Account
                                        using your login credentials from one of your SNS Accounts, we’ll be able to
                                        access and collect your name and email address and other PII that your privacy
                                        settings on the SNS Account permit us to access. When you make purchases on our
                                        Site, we may store your billing information, purchase history and your credit
                                        card information.</p>

                                    <p>Information Collected Using Log Files, Cookies and other Web
                                        Technologies.&nbsp; Like many website owners, we use automated data collection
                                        tools such as Cookies to collect certain information. “<strong>Cookies</strong>”
                                        are small text files that are placed on your hard drive by a Web server when you
                                        access our Services. We may use both session Cookies and persistent Cookies to
                                        identify that you’ve logged in to the Services and to tell us how and when you
                                        interact with our Services. We may also use Cookies to monitor aggregate usage
                                        and web traffic routing on our Services and to customize and improve our
                                        Services. Unlike persistent Cookies, session Cookies are deleted when you log
                                        off from the Services and close your browser. Although most browsers
                                        automatically accept Cookies, you can change your browser options to stop
                                        automatically accepting Cookies or to prompt you before accepting Cookies.
                                        Please note, however, that if you don’t accept Cookies, you may not be able to
                                        access all portions or features of the Services. Some third-party services
                                        providers that we engage (including third-party advertisers) may also place
                                        their own Cookies on your hard drive. Note that this Privacy Policy covers only
                                        our use of Cookies and does not include use of Cookies by such third
                                        parties.&nbsp;</p>

                                    <p>Information Related to Use of the Services. Our servers automatically record
                                        certain information about how a person uses our Services (we refer to this
                                        information as “<strong>Log Data</strong>”), including both Account holders and
                                        non-Account holders (either, a “<strong>User</strong>”). Log Data may include
                                        information such as a User’s Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type,
                                        operating system, the web page that a User was visiting before accessing our
                                        Services, the pages or features of our Services to which a User browsed and the
                                        time spent on those pages or features, search terms, the links on our Services
                                        that a User clicked on and other statistics. We use this information to
                                        administer the Services and we analyze (and may engage third parties to analyze)
                                        this information to improve and enhance the Services by expanding their features
                                        and functionality and tailoring them to our Users’ needs and preferences.</p>

                                    <p><strong>What Information Do We Share With Third Parties?</strong></p>

                                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                                    <p>We will not share any PII that we have collected from you except as described
                                        below:</p>

                                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                                    <p>Information Shared when Using the Services.&nbsp; There are various ways Members
                                        can make their PII publicly available through the Services or ways in which they
                                        can supply such information to Traina Interactive and other Members. Proving
                                        your PII and any other data through the Services, in connection with Experiences
                                        or to Traina Interactive whether you are Member or otherwise, is voluntary and
                                        should correlate with the degree of interaction you want to have with other
                                        users and Traina Interactive.&nbsp;</p>

                                    <p>&nbsp;</p>

                                    <p>When you apply to become a Luminary you will submit certain PII to us to complete
                                        your application.&nbsp; If you are approved and become a Luminary, the PII you
                                        provide in your Experience Listing will be publicly available for viewing via
                                        the Services.&nbsp; In connection with fulfilling in-person Experiences, as a
                                        Luminary, the contact information you provide for use on the day of the
                                        Experience will be shared with the purchasing End User.&nbsp; As an End User,
                                        the PII that is shared with the Luminary depends on the type of Experience and
                                        information about you that is necessary to process your request. For example,
                                        when you purchase a physical Product your name and billing address, and the
                                        name, shipping address and phone number for the recipient of the Product, will
                                        be shared with the Luminary; and when you request to schedule an Experience,
                                        your name and any other required information indicated in the Experience Listing
                                        like the names of any other participants, the location address and other details
                                        necessary to schedule the Experience will be shared with the Luminary to process
                                        your request.&nbsp; Luminaries are obligated to use your PII solely to fulfill
                                        the Experience and administer your related requests.&nbsp; Luminaries and End
                                        Users also have the opportunity to communicate with each other one-to-one via
                                        our Services in connection with the purchase, scheduling and participation in
                                        Experiences.</p>

                                    <p>Information Shared with Our Services Providers.&nbsp; We may engage third party
                                        service providers to work with us to administer, provide and improve the
                                        Services. These third-party services providers have access to your PII only for
                                        the purpose of performing services on our behalf.</p>

                                    <p>Information Shared with Third Parties. We may share aggregated information and
                                        non-identifying information with third parties for industry research and

                                    <p>Information Disclosed in Connection with Business Transactions. Information that
                                        we collect from our users, including PII, is considered to be a business asset.
                                        As a result, if we go out of business or enter bankruptcy or if we are acquired
                                        as a result of a transaction such as a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your
                                        PII may be disclosed or transferred to the third-party acquirer in connection
                                        with the transaction.</p>

                                        discretion, believe necessary or appropriate: (i) to respond to claims, legal
                                        process (including subpoenas); (ii) to protect our property, rights and safety

                                        and (iii) to stop any activity that we consider illegal, unethical or legally
                                        actionable activity.</p>

                                        information when you give us your consent to do so. For example, if you
                                        expressly request that we do so, we will share your PII with third-party sites
                                        or platforms, such as social networking sites.</p>

                                    <p><strong>International Transfer</strong></p>

                                    <p>Your PII may be transferred to, and maintained on, computers located outside of
                                        your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where the
                                        privacy laws may not be as protective as those in your jurisdiction. If you’re
                                        located outside the United States and choose to provide your PII to us, we may
                                        transfer your PII to the United States and process it there.&nbsp;</p>
